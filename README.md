## Hi, I'm Afaf! 👋
I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development, focusing on building a strong foundation in Linux, CLI, Git, and GitHub.

I'm passionate about understanding how things work behind the scenes. I don't just want to write code — I want to understand why it works, how it connects, and how to improve it.

Right now, I'm learning:

- ✅ Command Line tools (Linux)
- ✅ Git version control & GitHub
- ☑️ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (coming soon!)

My goal is to build clean, elegant, and meaningful web applications — and to grow every day as a developer.

Thanks for visiting my profile!
